{"user": "Human", "index": 5, "text": "Excellent question! When the toy was in the bookshelf, it was visible to the naked eye thus making it look disorganized. But when we are keeping it in the cupboard, it makes the bookshelf look neat because the cupboard is designed to be closed hence the toy would not make the cupboard untidy.", "intent": "Inform_action"}

{"user": "Human", "index": 6, "text": "Yes, you are absolutely right!", "intent": "Yes-no_positive"}
{"user": "Human", "index": 7, "text": "Now grab the other toy.", "intent": "Inform_next_step"}
