utt29 : u:  and then send them <sil> to <sil> 
            Bath which should be three hours right 
utt30 : s:  four + hours + 
utt31 : u:  + wait + no <sil> that's impossible wait 
utt32 :     hm <sil> let me think for a second 
utt33 :     wha- <sil> hm <sil> it takes two hours from Elmira to Corning 
utt34 : s:  yep 
utt35 : u:  and <sil> one hour from Corning to Dansville 
utt36 : s:  one hour- yep 
utt37 : u:  hm <sil> let me think here 
utt38 :     there are no boxcars at Avon right 
utt39 : s:  there're no bo- right 
utt40 : u:  hm 
utt41 :     hm 
utt42 : s:  so what exactly ar- are you trying to do + so your goal is + 
utt43 : u:  + okay <sil> well + 
utt44 :     the goal is <sil> transport two boxcars of bananas from <sil> 
            Corning <sil> or to Corning <sil> by eleven a.m. 
utt45 : s:  okay 
utt46 : u:  at midnight <sil> um <sil> 
            the only problem is there are no boxcars <sil> that <sil> are at <sil> 
            Avon 
utt47 :     which is where the + banana warehouse is + so 
utt48 : s:  + right <sil> right + 
utt49 :     so + it'll take us at + least <sil> six hours to get <sil> boxcars 
utt50 : u:  + one of the + 
utt51 :     to get boxcars and go back <sil> and then an hour to fill up 
utt52 :     and <sil> then it would take <sil> you- y- you would get to <sil> 
            Bath in time but you'd need an extra two hours to get to Corning <sil> 
            or an + extra hour + to get to + Corning + 
utt53 : s:  + okay + 
utt54 :     + so it + takes us six hours to pick up the boxcars and go + back + 
            <sil> to Avon 
utt55 : u:  + right + 
utt56 : s:  and then <sil> 
            loading them up takes seven hours and then to get to Corning <brth> 
            takes four more hours so that would be <sil> eleven hours 
utt57 : u:  wait <sil> to go from <sil> Avon to Dansville 
utt58 : s:  + yep + 
utt59 : u:  + and Dansville + back that's <sil> that would be six o'clock + <sil> 
            right + 
utt60 : s:  + right + 
utt61 :     yep 
utt62 :     so we load up + <sil> the orange ooh- we load up the bananas + 
utt63 : u:  + and then <sil> loading up <sil> that would be seven + o'clock 
utt64 : s:  yeah 
utt65 : u:  + is it + 
utt66 : s:  + we then + go to <sil> Dansville + + 
utt67 : u:  + is + it two or three hours <sil> to get to Dansville 
utt68 : s:  three hours <sil> and then <brth> one hour to get to Corning 
utt69 : u:  right <sil> so that would make it <sil> twelve o'clock wouldn't it 
utt70 : s:  um <sil> six <sil> plus one is seven <sil> ten <sil> eleven hours
