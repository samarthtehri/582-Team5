            for the orange juice to arrive at Avon 
utt4  :     so <sil> + I'm assu- + <sil> uh <sil> we probably should do the <sil>

            all the engines except for E two are going <sil> 
            undergoing routine maintenance we can only use <sil> engine E two 
utt10 : s:  okay 
utt11 : u:  um <sil> let's see <sil> uh 
utt12 :     well w- <sil> like I said we should <sil> 
            we should do the bananas first

            uh <laughter> 
utt16 : s:  do you have to go all the way + to Avon + 
utt17 : u:  + w- w- + right <sil> and we should <sil> yeah let's just <sil> 
            that's what <sil> two <sil> one <sil> is it four from Avon to Dansville 
utt18 : s:  three hours 
utt19 : u:  three okay so <sil> so it's six hours total <sil> to get there

utt28 : s:  yes 
utt29 : u:  okay <brth> so <sil> I <sil> I'm <sil> 
            I'm thinking the best thing to do would be <sil> 
            to do the bananas first since they're the things with the time limit

            to Avon <sil> + through + Dansville

utt33 :     okay 
utt34 : u:  cause I think that's the shorter way so that's six hours <sil> 
            and then <sil> then <sil> + and we already have + <sil> 
            and we have to load the three boxcars that we picked up in Dansville
