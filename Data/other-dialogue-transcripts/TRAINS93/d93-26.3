utt25 : u:  okay <sil> um 
utt26 :     I'm supposed to get the maximum number of boxcars <sil> of oranges <sil> 
            um that you could get to Bath by seven a.m. 
utt27 :     I don't know if that's is that the maximum number <sil> possible <sil>

            calculate whether another plan is available <sil> um 
utt29 :     the only additional boxcars available <sil> 
            are at Bath and it is impossible to use them in any plan that must <sil> 
            be achieved by seven a.m. 
utt30 :     therefore I would conclude <brth> 
            that you have gotten the maximum number of boxcars to Bath within the 
            required time frame 
utt31 : u:  okay <sil> so that <sil> is the plan
