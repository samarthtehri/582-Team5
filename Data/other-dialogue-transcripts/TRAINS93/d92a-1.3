utt10 : u:  + I need a + 
utt11 :     + okay + 
utt12 : s:  + so you've + got the engines at Elmira and uh 
utt13 : u:  Avon 
utt14 : s:  Avon 
utt15 : u:  okay <sil> I guess <sil> with one engine <sil> 
            will I be able to take the tanker <sil> plus four boxcars <sil> 
            no I + need <sil> two right + 
utt16 : s:  + no <sil> you'll + need two engines 
utt17 : u:  okay <sil> um <sil> take the two engines from Elmira <sil> 
            engine two and three 
utt18 : s:  okay 
utt19 : u:  and <sil> we can get the orange juice <sil> from Elmira <sil> 
            and + take + 
utt20 : s:  + we'll have <sil> + to make the orange juice actually so we'll + have 
            to + get <sil> oranges <sil> um <sil> 
            from Corning and move them to Elmira to make the orange juice 
utt21 : u:  + oh + 
utt22 :     okay <sil> so <sil> engine two <sil> goes to Corning 
utt23 : s:  okay 
utt24 : u:  to get <sil> oranges 
utt25 : s:  okay 
utt26 : u:  and take it back <sil> to <sil> Elmira 
utt27 : s:  okay so we'll take a <sil> bo(xcar)- <sil> we need one right <sil> 
            so we'll take one boxcar <sil> + with us as we go + 
utt28 : u:  + mm-hm <sil> yeah + 
utt29 : s:  okay <sil> so that'll <sil> be two hours to Corning <sil> 
            uh to pick up the oranges one hour to load <sil> plus two <sil> 
            hours to get back 
utt30 :     um <sil> and then one hour to make the orange juice 
utt31 :     so then we would have <sil> so that would <sil> 
            be after six hours we'd have the <sil> tanker of orange juice <sil> 
            at <sil> ready at Elmira 
utt32 : u:  is there a <sil> quicker way 
utt33 : s:  um 
utt34 :     no that looks about the fastest one thing we will need we'll need a 
            <sil> a tanker car to tran- transport the orange juice 
utt35 : u:  okay when we're at <sil> 
            when we're at Corning can + we take + it back with us 
utt36 : s:  + yes + 
utt37 :     yes okay <sil> so when we're at Corning we'll <sil> 
            uh pick up a tanker car 
utt38 :     okay and we'll go back with the oranges in the tanker car <sil> 
            make the orange juice <sil> and we can load it in the tanker car 
utt39 :     okay <sil> then uh 
utt40 : u:  okay <sil> then <sil> the <sil> k- <sil> 
            is <noise> one engine able to carry a tanker plus two boxcars 
utt41 : s:  yes 
utt42 : u:  okay <sil> so the engine with the tanker 
utt43 : s:  mm-hm 
utt44 : u:  will take <sil> two <sil> additional <sil> boxcars 
utt45 : s:  okay 
utt46 : u:  uh- <sil> <noise> <sil> and go to Corning <sil> where we <sil> 
            will pick up <sil> oranges <sil> to put in the boxcars 
utt47 : s:  okay 
utt48 : u:  and then straight to Bath 
utt49 : s:  okay so that'll take <sil> 
            uh two hours to get to Corning an hour to load <sil> 
            the oranges and two hours to get to Bath 
utt50 :     so that'll be another five hours <sil> okay so then it'll be eleven 
utt51 : u:  and then the other engine <sil> will have <sil> one <sil> boxcar right 
utt52 : s:  uh the other engine 
utt53 : u:  it won't have any 
utt54 : s:  no it + won't have + any 
utt55 : u:  + okay + 
utt56 : s:  yeah 
utt57 : u:  so the second <sil> the third engine <sil> whatever which one was <sil> 
            still there 
utt58 :     will go <sil> has to go <sil> to Corning <sil> to Dansville 
utt59 : s:  okay 
utt60 : u:  to pick up another bo(xcar)- <sil> well another two boxcars 
utt61 :     and then <sil> back down to Corning <sil> to load <sil> the <sil> 
            oranges 
utt62 : s:  okay so it'll take three hours to get to Dansville 
utt63 :     and uh we'll <sil> pick up <sil> the <sil> boxcars <sil> 
            and go back to Corning 
utt64 :     and then we gotta load oranges we'll take another hour 
utt65 :     um and then two hours to get to Bath so that will total <brth> 
            will take <sil> uh seven hours to do that 
utt66 :     + <click> okay + 
utt67 : u:  + is there <sil> + there's no other quicker way right 
utt68 : s:  uh I <sil> don't <sil> 
            think so let's see what so the one that takes the longest is to make 
            <sil> the orange juice 
utt69 :     and there doesn't seem to be a <sil> quicker way to <sil> 
            do that because we have to go get the oranges <sil> and back again 
utt70 :     right no that looks like the fastest 
utt71 : u:  okay <sil> so 
utt72 :     but do we still need one more boxcar 
utt73 : s:  uh 
utt74 : u:  I think 
utt75 : s:  no I think we have <sil> two with the first engine <sil> 
            + with the <sil> + the we have the orange juice in two <brth> 
            oh how many did we + need + 
utt76 : u:  + uh- + 
utt77 :     + we needed + five so + well + 
utt78 : s:  + oh we needed + five in <sil> + uh total + 
utt79 : u:  + yeah well + 
utt80 : s:  oh we need one more yes 
utt81 : u:  so 
utt82 : s:  oh what we 
utt83 : u:  couldn't we just u- <sil> attach that <sil> 
            you said three boxcars + were for one engine + 
utt84 : s:  + right we could've just taken + three from Dansville 
utt85 : u:  okay <sil> then <sil> the problem's finished 
utt86 : s:  right <sil> okay
