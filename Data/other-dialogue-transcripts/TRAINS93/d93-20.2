utt67 : u:  I can't separate it

            you have to start with the engine <sil> in El(mira)- <sil> 
            well either in Elmira or Avon right 
utt69 : u:  right 
utt70 : s:  and then you have to get <sil>

utt98 : u:  + huh <sil> Elmira + with <sil> two boxcars <sil> in ra- <sil> 
            we go to Corning and we pick up a kan- <sil> a tanker

            that's five in the morning 
utt103: s:  well if you're gonna make orange juice you have to pick up orange juice 
            it's in Corning <sil> in order to make orange juice <sil> a- 
utt104: u:  I have to pick up oranges and then for them to make orange juice I have 
            to bring them the oranges 
utt105: s:  exactly 
utt106: u:  okay <sil> so <sil> <noise> <sil> ok(ay)- 
utt107: s:  so 
utt108: u:  okay <sil> um <sil> 
            picking up an engine and two boxcars in Elmira I'm going to Corning 
            <sil> picking up a tanker <sil> an hour for loading 
utt109: s:  mm-hm 
utt110: u:  so that's <sil> three in the + morning + 
utt111: s:  + so you- + 
utt112:     three in the morning 
utt113: u:  and then from Corning to Elmira <sil> 
            it's another two hours that's five 
utt114:     another hour to load that's + six + 
utt115: s:  + s- <sil> s- + 
utt116:     okay 
utt117: u:  and then I'll drive from Elmira <sil> to <sil> 
            Cor(ning)- back to Corning 
utt118: s:  okay 
utt119: u:  I guess I could've 
utt120: s:  you could've filled + up <sil> two + for the <sil> price of one 
utt121: u:  + <mumble> <sil> fill the + 
utt122:     okay + <sil> so + I'd done + that + 
utt123: s:  + so + 
utt124:     + you've already + done that + <sil> fine + 
utt125: u:  + okay + so I go straight to <sil> Avon and I get <sil> the <sil> 
            + bananas + 
utt126: s:  + so that's another + f- 
utt127: u:  four 
utt128: s:  four hours is that right <sil> okay 
utt129: u:  and then another hour for loading <sil> are you <sil> 
            keeping track of what time it is <sil> + or should I + 
utt130: s:  + um + so should w(e)- we should be at eleven I think 
utt131: u:  eleven <sil> but that that doesn't give enough <sil> 
            still doesn't give us enough time to get to Bath <sil> right 
utt132:     cause it's f- <sil> what <sil> another <sil> three hours or four hours 
utt133: s:  right 
utt134: u:  so <sil> we can't make it in time then <sil> it'll be late 
utt135: s:  well maybe we could use separate engines 
utt136: u:  okay <sil> yeah I suppose <sil> fine 
utt137:     alright so I can send them out <sil> both at the same time right 
utt138: s:  right 
utt139: u:  + <mumble> + 
utt140: s:  + both + engines can go + at the same time + 
utt141: u:  + <clear-throat> + <sil> okay <sil> so one engine <sil> will go to <sil> 
            do what I just said and just do the orange juice <sil> right 
utt142: s:  right so it will go from Corning to Bath at the end 
utt143: u:  right 
utt144: s:  okay 
utt145: u:  right <sil> and then the other engine will go with the two boxcars <sil> 
            and do what I said 
utt146:     you know <sil> by <sil> going from Elmira to Avon <sil> oh <sil> 
            Elmira stopping in Corning <sil> and then <sil> oh 
utt147: s:  no the other engine can start at Avon <sil> go to Dansville <sil> 
            back to Avon <sil> <noise> <sil> and <sil> pick up the <sil> 
            bananas and go to Bath 
utt148: u:  <mumble> <sil> that's <sil> time <sil> oh <sil> start at <sil> 
            but it c- <sil> okay yeah should I I mean that's fine with me 
utt149: s:  oh actually no it migh- 
utt150: u:  I think that would be 
utt151: s:  pre- 
utt152:     okay so what's you're final plan 
utt153: u:  okay <sil> first off <sil> I'm using both engines from Elmira 
utt154: s:  okay 
utt155: u:  one is gonna <sil> go by itself and pick up <sil> one tanker <sil> 
            of oran- <sil> can I carry oranges in tankers 
utt156: s:  no 
utt157: u:  then I can't do that then 
utt158: s:  you can take boxcars <sil> with you at <sil> 
            there are boxcars available at Elmira 
utt159: u:  three <sil> right <sil> two <sil> 
            well I guess alright and then I'll pick up another one on the way <sil> 
            <clear-throat> 
utt160:     alright so each engine has one boxcar <sil> I go to Corning <sil> 
            one of the engine goes <sil> picks up a <sil> 
            they both fill up with oranges <sil> that's another hour
