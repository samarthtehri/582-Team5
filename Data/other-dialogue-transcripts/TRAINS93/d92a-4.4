utt1  : s:  oh <sil> uh <sil> hello can I help you 
utt2  : u:  uh-huh <sil> okay sure <laughter> um <brth> <sil> 
            okay I've gotta determine the maximum number of boxcars of oranges <sil> 
            that I can get to Bath <sil> by seven a.m. tomorrow morning <sil> 
            <click> <sil> okay 
utt3  : s:  Bath <sil> by seven a.m. 
utt4  : u:  yeah <sil> alright <sil> um <sil> <click> <sil> 
            I guess the first thing I do is take <sil> engine two <sil> and <sil> 
            the two boxcars <sil> from + Elmira + 
utt5  : s:  + mm-hm + 
utt6  : u:  um <sil> <click> <sil> go to Corning t- <sil> two hours 
utt7  : s:  right 
utt8  : u:  okay <sil> um <sil> from Corn- <sil> go to Dansville <sil> 
            to pick up <sil> the other three boxcars <sil> which would + be + 
utt9  : s:  + okay + 
utt10 : u:  um <sil> hm I don't know if the <sil> 
            okay that'll be three hours right <sil> I have + five box- + 
utt11 : s:  + oh let's + see <sil> um <sil> right 
utt12 : u:  does it <sil> take any time to <sil> hook up the boxcars 
utt13 : s:  uh no 
utt14 : u:  okay <sil> so I'd have five boxcars in Dansville after <sil> 
            at three a.m. <sil> <click> <sil> 
            okay so I drive an hour back to Corning 
utt15 : s:  okay 
utt16 : u:  um <sil> which would make it <sil> what four a.m. 
utt17 : s:  + right + 
utt18 : u:  + with five + boxcars <sil> an hour to fill up <sil> this <sil> 
            does it still take the same amount of time with <sil> + five box- + 
utt19 : s:  + right + 
utt20 : u:  okay 
utt21 :     so that would bring us to five a.m. <sil> and then two hours to Bath 
utt22 : s:  okay 
utt23 : u:  + that give us + 
utt24 : s:  + uh there's + a <sil> problem that <sil> uh <sil> 
            an engine can only <sil> pull three loaded boxcars <sil> at a time 
utt25 : u:  oh it can only pull three loaded boxcars 
utt26 : s:  yeah <sil> and any number of unloaded boxcars 
utt27 : u:  okay + + 
utt28 : s:  + + so when you made the o- <sil> 
            orange juice at Corning you wouldn't <sil> uh be able to <sil> 
            + um <sil> pull all + of them out 
utt29 : u:  + okay well + 
utt30 :     <click> <sil> okay when I filled them up at Corning <sil> 
            I could send engine three <sil> 
            from Elmira to Corning at that point cause the track would be clear 
            right 
utt31 : s:  right 
utt32 : u:  and it could pick up the other two boxcars 
utt33 : s:  + mm-hm + 
utt34 : u:  + that are full + <sil> that engine <sil> two couldn't take 
utt35 : s:  right 
utt36 : u:  um <sil> <click> <sil> but then they both couldn't go to Bath <sil> 
            could they 
utt37 : s:  um <sil> not at the same time 
utt38 : u:  okay <sil> okay I see alright <sil> I know what I gotta do 
utt39 :     alright so uh <sil> alright I'm gonna have engine two <sil> 
            go through then and pick up the <sil> um the boxcars <sil> in Dansville 
utt40 : s:  okay 
utt41 : u:  like we planned on doing except he's not gonna take the original two 
            boxcars 
utt42 : s:  okay 
utt43 : u:  and after he leaves <sil> 
            then engine three can take the two boxcars that are at Elmira 
utt44 : s:  right 
utt45 : u:  and fill them up at Corning 
utt46 : s:  + <click> uh-huh + 
utt47 : u:  + and take <sil> + take them to Bath 
utt48 : s:  okay so engine <sil> two will have to leave an hour <sil> 
            after I mean engine three will have to leave an hour after engine two 
            then 
utt49 : u:  yeah correct 
utt50 : s:  okay 
utt51 : u:  okay so <brth> 
            but engine three would still be able to make it to Bath because he's not 
            going through Dansville 
utt52 : s:  right 
utt53 : u:  okay so they would <sil> both be taken care of <sil> and then uh 
utt54 : s:  so <sil> engine <sil> two is going <sil> uh <sil> to Corning <sil> 
            to Dansville <sil> pick up three boxcars and back to Corning 
utt55 : u:  right to fill up 
utt56 : s:  right and meanwhile engine three leaves an hour later <sil> 
            gets to Corning the same time that <sil> engine two gets to Dansville 
utt57 : u:  right 
utt58 : s:  so engine <sil> three loads <sil> + the + 
utt59 : u:  + and l- + <sil> and leaves Corning <sil> 
            while the other one's getting + back to Corning + 
utt60 : s:  + so it <sil> so it + loads the oranges while the <sil> 
            while engine two is getting to Corning and then it <sil> 
            goes on to Bath <sil> um <sil> while engine <sil> two + is loading + 
utt61 : u:  + is <sil> is + loading <sil> right 
utt62 : s:  okay and then engine two follows 
utt63 : u:  okay 
utt64 : s:  + alright + 
utt65 : u:  + and + <sil> I <sil> 
            don't believe that in the seven hours we can fit engine one <sil> 
            into the <sil> equation here <sil> without running over the same tracks 
utt66 : s:  uh 
utt67 : u:  or maybe if- 
utt68 : s:  well from engine one the <sil> the quickest way <sil> to <sil> 
            Corning + <sil> + yeah that would be four hours already 
utt69 : u:  + <mumble> be at Dansville + 
utt70 :     right so that's not gonna be possible 
utt71 : s:  um 
utt72 : u:  to pick up bopf- <sil> 
            pick up boxcars fill them and bring them back <sil> + so we can't + 
utt73 : s:  + the <sil> the + only other boxcars are at Bath 
utt74 : u:  + right + 
utt75 : s:  + and that's + <sil> that's too far 
utt76 : u:  yeah <sil> okay so we're all done 
utt77 : s:  um 
utt78 : u:  is that right or 
utt79 : s:  well I'm wonder(ing)- I'm just wondering 
utt80 : u:  I don't think there's any way to incorporate those other two boxcars is 
            there 
utt81 : s:  I'm wondering if we take <sil> engine one <sil> 
            have engine one take the boxcars + at Dansville + 
utt82 : u:  + from <sil> from <sil> + Dansville 
utt83 : s:  and <sil> um <sil> try to send <brth> <sil> engine two <sil> to Bath 
utt84 : u:  + um + 
utt85 : s:  + uh + 
utt86 : u:  okay well engine one it's four hours from <sil> Avon to Dansville 
utt87 : s:  uh yeah 
utt88 : u:  and + then + 
utt89 : s:  + well three + hours from Avon to Dansville 
utt90 : u:  okay three hours <sil> and then an hour to Corning so + that's four + 
utt91 : s:  + right + 
utt92 : u:  an hour to fill up is five <sil> okay and two hours to Bath is seven 
utt93 : s:  right 
utt94 : u:  okay so we could do that 
utt95 :     + okay + 
utt96 : s:  + now + the <sil> question is whether <sil> can <sil> engine two <sil> 
            to Corning <sil> 
            would be two hours then to Bath would be four hours picking up the 
            boxcar and back would be six no there's no way to 
utt97 : u:  <mumble> no I don't think <sil> + I think + 
utt98 : s:  + to go + back to Bath 
utt99 :     + yes + 
utt100: u:  + no <sil> + I think + five + boxcars is the top 
utt101: s:  + s- + 
utt102:     right 
utt103: u:  okay 
utt104: s:  alright <sil> so I think we're done + <laughter> + 
utt105: u:  + okay we're finished <laughter> +
