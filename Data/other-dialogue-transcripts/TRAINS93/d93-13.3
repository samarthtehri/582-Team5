utt63 : s:  um <sil> it'll be there <sil> it'll get to Dansville at three a.m. <sil> 
            and then you wanna <sil> 
            do you take tho- want to take those back to Elmira 
utt64 :     so <sil> 
            engine E two with three boxcars will be back in Elmira at six a.m. 
utt65 :     is that what you + wanna do + 
utt66 : u:  + with + 
utt67 :     now I'm confused <sil> um <sil> engine two with three boxcars 
utt68 : s:  did you wanna pick up all three boxcars at Dansville + + 
utt69 : u:  + oh + yes <sil> + oh okay + 
utt70 : s:  + okay + 
utt71 : u:  oh so it went from Dansville <sil> Dansville to Corning to Elmira 
utt72 : s:  okay why do you wanna go back to Elmira 
utt73 : u:  I have to get seven boxcars of oranges to Elmira by nine a.m. 
utt74 : s:  okay <sil> so those'll be there 
utt75 :     did you <sil> 
            the three boxcars from Dansville do you want them to stop in Corning and 
            load <sil> and then go to Elmira 
utt76 : u:  yeah 
utt77 : s:  okay 
utt78 : u:  + don't + 
utt79 : s:  + they'll + be there 
utt80 : u:  don't they have to 
utt81 : s:  yeah + <laughter> + 
utt82 : u:  + okay + 
utt83 : s:  I just wanted to clarify that 
utt84 : u:  okay 
utt85 : s:  okay <sil> so those three will be i- <sil> back in Elmira at seven a.m. 
utt86 :     and <sil> the other 
utt87 : u:  and 
utt88 : s:  + the other + two can be there <sil> at <sil> five a.m. 
utt89 : u:  + okay + 
utt90 :     okay <sil> can I run <sil> tracks <sil> I can run <sil> 
            trains on the <sil> in the opposite direction right 
utt91 : s:  no 
utt92 : u:  so is this impossible 
utt93 : s:  let me see it depends on how the timing works <sil> 
            give me a minute <laughter> 
utt94 : u:  okay 
utt95 : s:  um <sil> let's see <sil> <noise> <sil> 
            we've got the two engines that go to Corning 
utt96 :     mm let me see 
utt97 :     no because while one is coming back from Dansville <sil> 
            the one from Corning can be going to Elmira <sil> it can be there 
utt98 :     I don't think you need to have any <sil> running <sil> 
            against the grain at any time 
utt99 : u:  so <sil> if they both <sil> okay both <sil> 
            engine two and engine three go from Elmira to Corning <sil> 
            they get there <sil> by <sil> two a.m. 
utt100: s:  uh-huh 
utt101: u:  and then <sil> engine <sil> 
            two procee- or engine three or how you have it <sil> 
            I don't want to mess you up 
utt102: s:  engine three is staying in Corning <sil> 
            and engine + two is + going to + Dansville + 
utt103: u:  + okay + 
utt104:     + okay + so engine two <sil> proceeds to Dansville gets there by <sil> 
            three 
utt105: s:  uh-huh 
utt106: u:  while <sil> um <sil> engine <sil> three stays and loads <sil> 
            and then <sil> takes <sil> so that's at three o'clock <sil> and then 
utt107: s:  uh-huh 
utt108: u:  by five 
utt109:     + it can be + back in Elmira 
utt110: s:  + <mumble> + 
utt111:     right 
utt112: u:  and <sil> by five <sil> um <sil> engine <sil> two can be loaded <sil> 
            to go <sil> so by seven 
utt113: s:  it'll be back in Elmira 
utt114: u:  okay <sil> so 
utt115:     I think I'm gonna say this is impossible unless how long does it take 
            from get to Corning to Bath 
utt116: s:  Corning to Bath is two hours 
utt117: u:  <click> oh wait <sil> um <sil> and to get engine one 
utt118:     oh hold on <sil> engine to get from <sil> 
            to get engine one from Avon to Dansville takes three hours right 
utt119: s:  engine one from Avon to Dansv- yes 
utt120: u:  and then <sil> um <sil> 
            so that could get there by nine ten eleve- no by twelve three 
utt121:     and then <sil> hm <sil> okay <sil> um <sil> how about <sil> 
            if I do all that <sil> and then at the same time have <sil> 
            engine one <sil> running from Avon to Bath 
utt122: s:  okay 
utt123: u:  cause we by that time <sil> yeah <sil> yeah from Avon to Bath <sil> 
            and then from Bath to Corning 
utt124: s:  mm-hm 
utt125: u:  and then from <sil> Corning to Elmira <sil> 
            can I do that with the tracks 
utt126: s:  um <sil> yes you can 
utt127:     so you want 
utt128: u:  and that'll be there by nine a.m. right 
utt129: s:  so + you want + engine E one to pick up <sil> the two boxcars in Bath 
utt130: u:  + yeah + 
utt131:     mm-hm 
utt132: s:  okay <brth> and then get to Corning <sil> 
            that'll take i- it'll be there at six a.m. <sil> 
            it can load the oranges and be in Elmira at nine a.m. 
utt133: u:  okay <sil> so <sil> that's seven boxes <sil> 
            of oranges by nine a.m. right 
utt134: s:  yes it is 
utt135: u:  okay <sil> I'm now finished
