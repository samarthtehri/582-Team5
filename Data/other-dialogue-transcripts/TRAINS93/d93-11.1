utt55 : u:  oh <sil> + okay + 
utt56 : s:  + and we + need okay so 
utt57 : u:  so with the <sil> three tankers we'll just <sil> 
            include the orange <sil> oranges in + that + 
utt58 : s:  + okay + but the thing is is that um <sil> 
            oranges can't go into tankers 
utt59 : u:  + oh <sil> right + 
utt60 : s:  + they can only go into boxcars + 
utt61 : u:  okay

utt63 : s:  about one to one <sil> yeah 
utt64 : u:  alright 
utt65 :     so we need to get <sil> a boxcar <sil> to <sil> o- <sil> to Elmira 
utt66 : s:  right 
utt67 : u:  um <sil> take one from Bath 
utt68 : s:  okay <sil> oh okay <sil> right okay

utt71 : u:  + <mumble> + 
utt72 : s:  + from + from Corning to Bath is two hours <sil> 
            whereas from Corning to Dansville is + like one + hour 
utt73 : u:  + okay + 
utt74 :     + so + 
utt75 : s:  + so we could + <sil> pick up + <brth> a boxcar there + 
utt76 : u:  + alright so we'll take uh + <sil> one boxfar <sil> boxcar uh <sil> 
            from Dansville through Corning to + Elmira + 
utt77 : s:  + okay <sil> + so we need an engine to move that boxcar 
utt78 : u:  okay 
utt79 :     um <sil> <noise> <sil> did we use the engine from Avon 
utt80 : s:  + yes we did + 
utt81 : u:  + we did + 
utt82 : s:  yep 
utt83 : u:  um <sil> okay <sil> <sil> alright so we'll take uh <sil> 
            engine E three from Elmira 
utt84 : s:  yep 
utt85 : u:  to Dansville 
utt86 : s:  yep 
utt87 : u:  then uh <sil> we can take that one boxcar <sil> to Elmira 
utt88 : s:  okay 
utt89 : u:  um <sil> then we 
utt90 : s:  did you all okay so um <sil> we need three boxcars all together right 
utt91 : u:  mm-hm

utt93 : u:  there are two + already at Elmira + 
utt94 : s:  + okay <sil> okay + 
utt95 :     so we'll take engine E three <sil> to take the two boxcars there <sil> 
            go to Corning then go to Dansville and then go back to Corning 
utt96 : u:  right 
utt97 : s:  so that'll <sil> get us <sil> to Corning at <sil> five a.m. 
utt98 : u:  okay <sil> then we have to uh <sil> transfer the OJ into the tanker 
utt99 : s:  okay we actually we have boxcars right at Corning <sil> 
            so we'll probably need to load the boxcars with oranges 
utt100: u:  okay 
utt101: s:  okay so we'll load the boxcars and that takes an hour so <sil> 
            at six a.m. we'll have <brth> three boxcars <sil> 
            loaded with orange juice at Corning 
utt102: u:  okay

            the three tankers 
utt104: s:  okay um <brth> only oran- orange juice can go onto tankers 
utt105: u:  so we have to take <sil> the <sil> orange juice <sil> 
            out of the boxcars <sil> into the + tankers + 
utt106: s:  + oh no + I see <sil> see at the orange warehouse <sil> we just <sil> 
            loaded in oranges <sil> into the boxcars 
utt107:     so what we're now gonna have to do is to <sil> t(o)- <sil> 
            to turn the oranges into orange juice at the OJ factory 
utt108: u:  alright 
utt109: s:  so <sil> so we have three boxcars of <sil> oranges <sil> at Corning 
utt110: u:  three boxcars of orange juice at Corning

utt124:     wh- wh- when we were loading up the oranges into the <sil> 
            into the boxcars 
utt125:     we could have also picked up the three tankers <brth> 
            and to have brought + them then to + Elmira 
utt126: u:  + yeah + 
utt127:     okay + +
