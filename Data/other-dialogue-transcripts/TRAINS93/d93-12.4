            here's the problem we need to transport two tankers of orange juice to 
            Avon and three boxcars of bananas to Elmira <brth> 
            uh the + bana(nas)- + 
utt3  : s:  + okay + so wait a second <brth> two tankers of 
utt4  : u:  orange juice

utt17 : s:  + oh + <sil> so it's <sil> t- <sil> lots of time 
utt18 : u:  okay and there isn't a set time for <sil> um 
utt19 : s:  okay 
utt20 : u:  the orange juice however <brth> our problem is that <sil> 
            all the other engines are in <sil> in undergoing maintenance 
utt21 : s:  okay so which engine can we use 
utt22 : u:  engine number two 
utt23 : s:  okay <sil> oh 
utt24 : u:  <click> <sil> 
            and since there's a time limit on the bananas I- I think we should work 
            with that problem first 
utt25 : s:  right <sil> right <sil> okay <sil> 
            so E two so we need three boxcars of bananas into Elmira <brth> okay 
utt26 : u:  okay <sil> I <sil> think <sil> that we should <sil> um <sil> 
            <noise> <sil> from Elmira <sil> take <sil> + engine + number two 
utt27 : s:  + yep + 
utt28 :     yep 
utt29 : u:  and <sil> we need to go to um <sil> Avon <sil> + and + 
utt30 : s:  + right + <sil> 
            so we also need three boxcars empty boxcars to bring with us 
utt31 : u:  can we use the boxcars there in Dansville since there's <sil> 
            three + there + 
utt32 : s:  + yeah + <sil> yeah <sil> a- <sil> and then as well um <sil> Dan- <sil> 
            um Dansville is on the faster path <sil> to Avon <sil> 
            so that works out well 
utt33 :     so we'll go e- so we'll take E two from Elmira <sil> to <brth> 
            Corning it'll get there at two a.m. and then to Dansville 
utt34 :     it'll get there at three a.m. we'll pick up three <sil> 
            boxcars and go to <sil> Avon and we'll get <sil> there 
utt35 : u:  wait a + minute + 
utt36 : s:  + at + six a.m. 
utt37 :     yep 
utt38 : u:  um 
utt39 :     okay <sil> we'll get there at six a.m. 
utt40 : s:  okay 
utt41 : u:  alright <sil> we need to load <sil> the uh <sil> three boxcars 
utt42 : s:  yep 
utt43 : u:  and <sil> return to Elmira 
utt44 : s:  okay so it'll be <sil> seven a.m. <sil> by the time we load in <sil> 
            load the bananas <brth> then we want to go back to Elmira 
utt45 :     so that'll get us to Dansville <sil> at <sil> ten a.m. <sil> 
            that'll get us to <sil> Corning <sil> at eleven a.m. 
utt46 : u:  + can we + 
utt47 : s:  + that'll get + us into Elmira at <sil> one p.m. 
utt48 : u:  if we stop to pick up two tankers in Corning 
utt49 : s:  yep 
utt50 : u:  will that <sil> delay us 
utt51 : s:  no 
utt52 : u:  oh <sil> we need to pick up two tankers <laughter> <sil> in Corning 
utt53 : s:  okay so what we want to do is is that on the way back <brth> 
            we're gonna pick up <sil> two tankers 
utt54 : u:  okay 
utt55 : s:  okay <sil> um oh wait a second tho(se)- <sil> 
            those those tankers are empty though right 
utt56 : u:  right 
utt57 : s:  okay <sil> so <sil> okay <sil> so um <sil> okay 
utt58 :     so <sil> at one p.m. here's <sil> the <sil> we will have <sil> 
            our three loaded boxcars of bananas and we'll have two empty tankers of 
            <sil> OJ 
utt59 : u:  at one p.m. in Elmira 
utt60 : s:  right 
utt61 : u:  okay <brth> + um + 
utt62 : s:  + and + we won't <sil> 
            but we won't have any oranges though to actually make the o- <sil> 
            orange juice 
utt63 : u:  oh <sil> wow we didn't load up the + <laughter> + 
utt64 : s:  + r- <sil> + right 
utt65 : u:  <laughter> <sil> okay 
utt66 : s:  so 
utt67 : u:  t- <sil> I think <sil> we need to uh <sil> I need <sil> 
            we need to um <sil> <click> <sil> in the initial trip 
utt68 : s:  yep 
utt69 : u:  uh when we went to pick up the bananas I think we needed to take uh 
            <sil> 
            the two boxcars from Elmira plus pick up three boxcars from Dansville 
utt70 : s:  okay <sil> so actually we could just leave the two boxcars at Corning 
utt71 :     so we could just take the <sil> + two + boxcars in <brth> 
            from Elmira to Corning okay let me <sil> note that 
utt72 : u:  + right + 
utt73 : s:  so <sil> two <sil> okay 
utt74 :     so <sil> when we come back we can have <sil> those <brth> 
            so what we'll do is is <sil> so we drop off the two boxcars in Corning 
utt75 :     and then while we're going to Dansville <brth> we could have them <sil> 
            loaded up <sil> then 
utt76 : u:  + right + 
utt77 : s:  + okay + 
utt78 :     so it's gonna be one p.m. <sil> so <sil> 
            let's go back to when we come back to Corning right 
utt79 :     we have three boxcars of bananas <sil> and we have <sil> 
            two boxcars of oranges waiting for us 
utt80 :     now the problem is is that one engine can <sil> pull at most three <sil> 
            three loaded boxcars 
utt81 : u:  <chuckle> <sil> + <noise> + 
utt82 : s:  + so + we're gonna have to leave those <sil> so w(e'll)- <sil> 
            we'll either have to leave the bananas at Corning or we'll have to leave 
            the <sil> oranges there 
utt83 : u:  okay <sil> <brth> leave the oranges 
utt84 : s:  okay 
utt85 : u:  okay we take the bananas <sil> deliver them to Elmira + + 
utt86 : s:  + yeah +

            back on route to Elmira to make orange juice 
utt96 : s:  okay <brth> so we'll get to <sil> so at Corning <brth> 
            so we'd be at Corning at three a.m. <brth> we'd be in Elmira at <sil> 
            five a.m. <sil> five p.m. I <sil> m- I mean
