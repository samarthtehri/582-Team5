utt84 : u:  moving to Dansville + which had + three boxcars + + 
utt85 : s:  + right +

utt88 : s:  yep <sil> okay 
utt89 : u:  + and + 
utt90 : s:  + so + we should be in Corning then with those three boxcars at <sil> 
            four a.m. 
utt91 : u:  right 
utt92 : s:  + okay + 
utt93 : u:  + the thing is + there's two boxcars available at Bath <sil> 
            that are sitting + unused + 
utt94 : s:  + right + <sil> right 
utt95 : u:  so 
utt96 : s:  so we so at like um three a.m. <brth> 
            we have engine E three in Corning <sil> 
            so it'll get to Bath at five a.m. 
utt97 : u:  mm-hm 
utt98 : s:  so did you want to do that 
utt99 : u:  okay <sil> yeah 
utt100: s:  okay so Corning will be there at three a.m. <sil> and on to <sil> 
            Bath <sil> so that'll be in Bath at five a.m. 
utt101: u:  + right + 
utt102: s:  + good + 
utt103:     + okay and then we're + gonna pick up those two boxcars 
utt104: u:  + and + 
utt105:     right 
utt106: s:  okay 
utt107: u:  and <sil> it takes an hour to get back to Corning 
utt108: s:  it takes an hour <sil> to get from <sil> Bath <sil> + from from + where 
utt109: u:  + right + 
utt110:     + from Bath + <sil> to Corning 
utt111: s:  + so f- + 
utt112:     okay that'll take two more hours <sil> 
            so we we'd get back into Bath at seven a.m. 
utt113: u:  right <sil> that doesn't do any good <sil> wait you'd g(et)- <sil> 
            you'd get <sil> back to Bath <sil> with one of + the + 
utt114: s:  + oh sorry + sorry <sil> we would get back <sil> to Corning 
utt115: u:  + right + 
utt116: s:  + at + seven a.m. wi- with the two boxcars <sil> loaded on <sil> 
            E three 
utt117: u:  hm 
utt118:     okay <sil> uh 
utt119: s:  so in as far as <sil> the other s- so as + far as engine E one + 
utt120: u:  + right <sil> there is there + should be one <sil> 
            there should be one engine <sil> uh <sil> at <sil> Corning right 
utt121: s:  um <sil> engine E two is there 
utt122: u:  right 
utt123: s:  um anyway it's gonna leave for Bath <sil> at <sil> three a.m. <brth> 
            so it'll get ba- to Bath at five a.m. 
utt124: u:  what about the other engine from + <sil> Elmira + 
utt125: s:  + the other engine + from <sil> <noise> <sil> the engine that a- <sil> 
            the other engine from A- <sil> um <sil> 
            Avon you mean or from + Elmira + 
utt126: u:  + from Elmira + 
utt127: s:  okay <sil> that engine wou(ld)- would have left at one a.m. right <brth> 
            would get to Corning at three a.m. <brth> 
            would get to Bath at five a.m. pick up the two boxcars and be back in 
            Corning at seven a.m. 
utt128: u:  and then it would take another two hours <sil> to get back to Bath <sil> 
            though 
utt129: s:  right exactly and y- and we would also ha(ve)- ha(ve)- have to load up 
            the oranges there + right + 
utt130: u:  + right + <sil> + so that's no good + 
utt131: s:  + so <sil> + we would get there at ten a.m. 
utt132: u:  right <sil> um <sil> well <sil> at least could we send the uh <sil> 
            three boxcars <sil> and the engine from Dansville <sil> to Corning 
utt133: s:  yeah <sil> okay so that'll get <sil> to <sil> 
            Dans- so that'll get to Corning at <sil> four a.m. 
utt134: u:  okay <sil> and <sil> I guess send that <sil> 
            load that up and then send it to Bath I assume 
utt135: s:  okay <sil> + so + 
utt136: u:  + that would be the best at + this point 
utt137: s:  okay so we would load it up at <sil> so it'll <sil> 
            take an hour to load it up so at <sil> five a.m. 
utt138:     we can go <sil> to <sil> Bath <sil> so we would get there at <sil> 
            + seven + a.m. 
utt139: u:  + right + 
utt140:     okay so that would be a total <sil> five 
utt141: s:  yep 
utt142: u:  available <sil> at <sil> by eight a.m. 
utt143: s:  right 
utt144: u:  correct 
utt145: s:  yep 
utt146: u:  okay <sil> uh I would assume that <sil> that was <sil> 
            that would be the best of the current situation 
utt147: s:  so um <sil> what are you trying to <sil> do exactly 
utt148: u:  + okay + 
utt149: s:  + what's your um + <sil> goal 
utt150: u:  uh <sil> 
            okay determine the maximum number of boxcars of oranges that you could 
            get to Bath <sil> by seven a.m. + tomorrow morning + 
utt151: s:  + oh okay + <brth> see one other option is is that um <sil> 
            I'm wondering if we took engine E one <sil> 
            as oppo- and have it pick up the two boxcars at Bath 
utt152: u:  yeah <sil> + that's what I thought of afterwords <sil> + but <sil> 
            I said move + it <inc> Dansville + 
utt153: s:  + and then go to Corning + 
utt154:     + yeah but the thing is + is that <sil> that won't work <sil> 
            because it takes six hours to go from Avon to + Corning + 
utt155: u:  + right + 
utt156: s:  and then so yeah I think <sil> five is about the most that we'll get 
utt157: u:  right 
utt158: s:  okay good <sil> so we're done 
utt159: u:  okay
