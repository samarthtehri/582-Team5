            boxcar <sil> to Elmira <sil> full of oranges 
utt80 : s:  okay <sil> you could save an hour <sil>

            while you're bringing the tank cars back to Elmira 
utt81 : u:  okay <sil> uh <sil> + then I'd + <sil> like to do that

utt83 :     okay 
utt84 : u:  so now what time is it when I have everything I need <sil> in Elmira 
utt85 : s:  uh in 
utt86 : u:  when I'm in Elmira 
utt87 : s:  okay right <sil> just + a sec + 
utt88 : u:  + after the + orange juice is made 
utt89 : s:  uh it's nine a.m. 
utt90 : u:  it's sorry what time 
utt91 : s:  nine a.m. uh wait a second uh also loading the <sil> the <sil> 
            let's see let me see <sil> <mumble> <sil> <mumble> <sil> 
            it's gonna take an hour to unload <mumble> <sil> should be noon 
utt92 : u:  + noon + 
utt93 : s:  + is it i- + 
utt94 :     yeah it'll take an hour to unload the oranges <brth> 
            an hour to make the orange juice <brth> and an hour to load the tanker 
utt95 : u:  okay <sil> can you think of a quicker way <sil> for me to <sil> 
            accomplish this by one <sil> p.m. 
utt96 : s:  <clear-throat> <sil> um 
utt97 :     yes you could send the engine <sil> from <sil> Avon <sil> 
            to Corning it'll take it four hours to get there 
utt98 :     uh <sil> a- the engine at Elmira <sil> take two boxcars to Corning 
utt99 :     um <sil> so four hours later <sil> 
            picks up the two tankers and goes to Elmira 
utt100:     four hours later <sil> so it takes <sil> 
            six hours to get the oranges to Elmira <sil> and the tankers <sil> 
            and all three engines 
utt101: u:  okay 
utt102: s:  so that would be <sil> six a.m. 
utt103: u:  alright <sil> and now how what time + will it be + 
utt104: s:  + okay so + then it'll take <sil> then it'll take <sil> 
            three hours so it'll be nine a.m. 
utt105: u:  can I get from Elmira to Avon in four hours 
utt106: s:  no 
utt107: u:  okay 
utt108:     then <sil> what I wanna do <sil> is have <sil> 
            engine E two and E three <sil> and the two boxcars <sil> 
            go from Elmira to Corning 
utt109: s:  okay 
utt110: u:  I'd like to then <sil> return from Corning to <sil> Elmira <sil> 
            with both engines <sil> two boxcars of oranges <sil> and two tankers 
utt111: s:  <click> okay it takes an hour to load so that's <sil> five hours 
utt112: u:  and I'm back in Elmira with my <sil> boxcars and my tankers 
utt113: s:  right 
utt114: u:  so in three hours I can have <sil> orange juice 
utt115: s:  right so + that's + 
utt116: u:  + lo- all + loaded up and ready to go 
utt117: s:  that's right 
utt118: u:  so it's eight o'clock in Elmira 
utt119: s:  right 
utt120: u:  can I get from Elmira to Avon in five hours 
utt121: s:  no 
utt122: u:  can you think of a better way to do this 
utt123: s:  no that looks about as quick as you can get 
utt124:     + quickest- + 
utt125: u:  + can you <sil> + conceive of any way to get <sil> 
            to accomplish this task by one p.m. 
utt126: s:  no it seems like the close- <sil> uh <sil> 
            earliest you can get it done is two p.m. 
utt127: u:  uh <sil> with uh out any exception 
utt128: s:  I don't see any other way to do it <sil> uh <sil> 
            the closest oranges <sil> are <sil> Corning 
utt129: u:  okay 
utt130:     so we necessarily we have to go from Elmira to Avon <sil> th- <sil> 
            we have to go take the orange juice from Elmira to Avon 
utt131: s:  uh-huh 
utt132: u:  and that's <sil> gonna take us five hours no matter what 
utt133: s:  that's right 
utt134: u:  and we have to spend three hours in + Elmira + 
utt135: s:  + well that's + actually go- that's gonna take six hours no matter + 
            what + 
utt136: u:  + six + hours no matter what 
utt137: s:  right 
utt138: u:  and we have to spend three hours in Elmira before that <sil> 
            unloading and loading right 
utt139: s:  right 
utt140: u:  so <sil> from getting to Elmira <sil> with <sil> the oranges <sil> 
            to Avon <sil> takes nine hours at the minimum 
utt141: s:  right 
utt142: u:  so in order to accomplish this task <sil> we need <sil> 
            to get the oranges to Elmira in four hours 
utt143: s:  mm-hm 
utt144: u:  to get a- <sil> to get any engine <sil> to get anything <sil> 
            on any engine to Corning <sil> to Elmira <sil> 
            takes at least four hours 
utt145: s:  that's right 
utt146: u:  so that wou- <sil> that <sil> takes our <sil> 
            thirteen hours right there 
utt147: s:  + right + 
utt148: u:  + and we haven't + accounted for loading up the oranges 
utt149: s:  that's right 
utt150: u:  so it doesn't seem as though there's a way to complete this task <sil> 
            do you agree 
utt151: s:  uh no it doesn't 
utt152: u:  okay I'm f- now finished
