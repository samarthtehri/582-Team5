            a set of boxcars in an hour

            two + hours + 
utt40 : s:  + two + hours + yeah + 
utt41 : u:  + oh + so that would be perfect <sil> if we do it that w(ay)- <sil>

utt50 : s:  + another two + hours 
utt51 : u:  f- okay <sil> so as that would be the maximum too wouldn't it 
utt52 : s:  + yeah that's right +
