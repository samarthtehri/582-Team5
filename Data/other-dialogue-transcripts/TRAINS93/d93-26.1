utt42 : s:  we fill the fre- three tankers at Elmira I would presume because that's 
            where we're making the orange juice 
utt43 : u:  so the tankers aren't available <sil> at <sil> 
            Elmira they're only available at Corning

utt48 : s:  <click> very good <sil> that would leave you with <brth> 
            two boxcars of bananas at Bath an additional load of bananas stored at 
            Bath 
utt49 :     uh three empty boxcars at Bath and three tankers full of orange juice at 
            Bath 
utt50 :     let me calculate how long that will take 
utt51 :     engine E one is going to travel to <sil> from Avon <sil> 
            to Dansville and take approximately <sil> 
            three hours so at three a.m. it will arrive at <sil> 
            Dansville and pick up three boxcars 
utt52 :     <click> I would then recommend <sil> instead of <sil> re- <sil> 
            it's okay never mind <brth> uh we're then returning to Avon 
utt53 :     it's now seven a.m. <sil> we're picking up bananas <sil> 
            and traveling to Bath <sil> and we'll arrive there at noon 
utt54 :     we'll unload up one load <sil> of <sil> bananas <sil> 
            and decouple the other two <sil> boxcars picking up two empty <sil> 
            ones <sil> um 
utt55 :     and we'll then travel to Corning <sil> and arrive there at three p.m. 
utt56 :     at that point we'll load <sil> all three boxcars <sil> with <sil> 
            oranges <sil> pick up the three empty tankers and travel toward Elmira 
utt57 :     at Elmira we'll unload <sil> the oranges and convert them into <sil> 
            orange juice 
utt58 :     and <sil> travel back to Corning with the orange juice 
utt59 :     and then travel back <sil> to <sil> Bath <sil> with <sil> 
            the orange juice
