utt137: u:  okay so I want to use Dansville 
utt138:     um 
utt139:     yeah if I <sil> if I take engine one from Avon and go to <sil> 
            Corning <sil> via Dansville <sil> stopping in Dansville <sil> 
            to get <sil> two boxcars 
utt140: s:  uh-huh 
utt141: u:  pick up <sil> oranges at Corning

utt144: s:  okay 
utt145: u:  and pick up the + + bananas 
utt146: s:  + t- + 
utt147:     okay <sil> that would be <sil> uh <sil> ten <sil> ten a.m. when <sil> 
            you're loaded with bananas at Avon 
utt148: u:  and how long does it take to get to Bath <sil> + from there + 
utt149: s:  + four + hours 
utt150: u:  oh so that won't work either 
utt151:     <laughter> <sil> um <sil> hm 
utt152:     um <sil> <laughter> <sil> let's see 
utt153:     um 
utt154:     hm 
utt155: s:  well y(ou)- you could <sil> um <sil> you could <sil> a- <sil> 
            uh take <sil> the oranges with the orange juice 
utt156:     if you <sil> too(k)- <sil> if you didn't go <sil> with engine <sil> 
            E one over to <sil> to Corning 
utt157: u:  mm-hm 
utt158: s:  to get the oranges 
utt159:     i- i- it takes an extra three hours to go from Dansville to Corning pick 
            up oranges and back to Dansville 
utt160: u:  mm-hm 
utt161: s:  so if you'd had engine E one just do the <sil> 
            just take the bananas <sil> I think you could make it

            load the bananas <sil> and go to Bath 
utt165:     that would <sil> make it there <sil> at <sil> uh eleven o'clock 
utt166: u:  okay so that would leave <sil> only two more things to be delivered 
utt167: s:  right well the <sil> the orange juice you already have <sil> uh <sil> 
            getting there on time with engine E three

            uh instead of l- just loading one <sil> 
            taking one boxcar and loading it with oranges 
utt188:     uh if you take two boxcars and load them both with oranges
