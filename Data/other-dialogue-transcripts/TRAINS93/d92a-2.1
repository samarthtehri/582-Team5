utt56 : u:  + that + way we would have the oran- <sil> we would have engine <sil> 
            I can't remember either two or three that we used for the <brth> <sil> 
            whatever one we didn't use for the bananas <sil> 
            and used it for the orange juice 
utt57 : s:  mm-hm

utt65 : s:  uh <sil> still for the bananas and so <sil> 
            engine three now for the orange juice 
utt66 :     so let's see <sil> um <sil> let's go <sil> 
            let's work out the orange juice part again so + that would be engine + 
            three <sil> starting from Elmira 
utt67 : u:  + okay + 
utt68 :     mm-hm 
utt69 :     and then we're gonna go <sil> to <sil> Corning <sil> 
            and pick up a tanker and load it with orange juice <sil> 
            I'm sorry and then we have to go back to Elmira to get the orange juice 
utt70 : s:  okay <sil> + um + 
utt71 : u:  + and then + <sil> return to Corning <sil> and then to Bath 
utt72 : s:  alright <sil> so <sil> let's see <sil> um <sil> <click> <sil> 
            that will work with time I'm wondering if we're gonna <sil> 
            have these + trains running into each other + though 
utt73 : u:  + crash <sil> <laughter> + 
utt74 : s:  so <sil> um <sil> let me see now <sil> um 
utt75 : u:  well the one for the banana <sil> 
            we're just having the engine go from Elmira to <sil> 
            and taking the boxcar <sil> going to Corning 
utt76 : s:  mm-hm 
utt77 : u:  and then to Dan(sville)- <sil> mm <sil> <click> <sil> 
            we could either go to Bath or we could go to Dansville we should 
            probably go to Bath first 
utt78 :     go to Dansville pick up <sil> 
            I'm sorry go to Avon pick up the bananas and then come back to Bath 
utt79 :     that way the other one <sil> can be free <sil> 
            the orange juice one can be freely <sil> 
            travel back and forth to Corning 
utt80 : s:  mm-hm <sil> um <sil> right 
utt81 :     um <sil> let's see let's uh <sil> try and <sil> work this out so <sil> 
            engine <sil> engine one <sil> + starts + out <sil> at Avon 
utt82 : u:  + mm-hm + 
utt83 :     + mm-hm + 
utt84 : s:  + and it's + going <sil> um <sil> to Dansville 
utt85 : u:  <laughter> <sil> + mm-hm + 
utt86 : s:  + is that right + 
utt87 : u:  yeah 
utt88 : s:  + and then + 
utt89 : u:  + to pick up the + boxcar 
utt90 : s:  pick up a boxcar <sil> and then <sil> goes to Corning 
utt91 :     and <sil> picks up orange j- <sil> oranges 
utt92 : u:  + mm-hm + 
utt93 : s:  + and then + goes to Bath 
utt94 : u:  mm-hm 
utt95 : s:  okay <sil> uh <sil> and that will take a total of <sil> um <sil> 
            let's see <sil> total of s- <sil> of seven hours 
utt96 : u:  <click> okay 
utt97 : s:  and we're using that <sil> that <sil> path from Avon to Bath <sil> 
            there 
utt98 :     engine two <sil> was <sil> going <sil> to <sil> do the <sil> bananas 
utt99 : u:  mm-hm 
utt100: s:  so it was starting at Elmira <sil> and <sil> picking up a boxcar <sil> 
            is that right 
utt101: u:  yes 
utt102: s:  uh <sil> goes to Corning <sil> and then <sil> uh 
utt103: u:  can I use 
utt104: s:  actually you could go to Dansville <sil> 
            u- that is that the way you wanted to go <sil> yeah that's <sil> 
            uh <sil> i- they would both be in Dansville at the same time 
utt105: u:  + but then they'd + <sil> go the opposite + way + 
utt106: s:  + so + 
utt107:     + right + so I think they could <sil> 
            I think it's okay for them to cross as long as it's at a city <sil> um 
utt108: u:  can I use several boxcars for with one engine 
utt109: s:  yes 
utt110: u:  so we could've done this completely differently 
utt111: s:  yes 
utt112: u:  easily 
utt113:     <laughter> <sil> <brth> okay so what if <sil> we use <sil> 
            engine number one 
utt114: s:  uh-huh- <sil> so you want to <sil> you want to change the plan 
utt115: u:  <click> <sil> I don't know <sil> <noise> 
utt116: s:  <laughter> <sil> 
            + well let- let's work out + what we have so far and see if we want + to 
            change + 
utt117: u:  + <laugher> + 
utt118:     + alright + 
utt119: s:  okay <sil> so engine two is <sil> 
            getting a boxcar going to Corning <sil> um <sil> 
            and then going to Dansville 
utt120: u:  mm-hm 
utt121: s:  and then <sil> going <sil> to Avon <sil> um <sil> 
            and then going to- <sil> picking up bananas 
utt122: u:  mm-hm 
utt123: s:  and then going to um <sil> Bath 
utt124:     um <sil> okay so that <sil> that's the longest <sil> 
            part that takes <sil> eleven hours 
utt125:     um <sil> and now <sil> engine three 
utt126: u:  mm-hm 
utt127: s:  is uh <sil> see it's going from Elmira <sil> to Corning 
utt128: u:  mm-hm 
utt129: s:  uh <sil> and <sil> picking u- picking up a tanker car 
utt130: u:  mm-hm 
utt131: s:  going back to Elmira <sil> no <sil> wait <sil> uh <sil> 
            we we need to get oranges to Elmira 
utt132:     so we nee(d)- we need a uh boxcar to take oranges 
utt133: u:  mm-hm <sil> we can get a boxcar at Elmira + though + 
utt134: s:  + okay + so it's <sil> starting out with a boxcar 
utt135:     uh <sil> going to Corning loading oranges <sil> and picking up a tanker 
utt136:     uh <sil> going back to Elmira <sil> uh 
utt137:     making the orange juice <sil> and then going to Corning <sil> 
            and then to Bath 
utt138: u:  mm-hm 
utt139: s:  okay so that's nine hours <sil> and let's see if there's any <sil> 
            conflicts here 
utt140:     um <sil> so it's the engine <sil> two and three we want <sil> uh <sil> 
            they would <sil> uh <sil> 
            w(e)- we wouldn't want them both to start out at the same time <sil> um 
utt141:     and <sil> um <sil> <mumble> let's see <sil> uh 
utt142:     think if we delay engine three for an hour then <sil> 
            then we're fine <sil> + um + 
utt143: u:  + <click> <sil> + okay 
utt144: s:  and <sil> we'll have everything done by eleven 
utt145: u:  good <sil> done 
utt146: s:  + okay + 
utt147: u:  + I'm + I'm now finished + <sil> I guess <laugher> + 
utt148: s:  + <laugher> <sil> + alright
