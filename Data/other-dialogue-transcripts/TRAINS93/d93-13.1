utt2  : u:  um yeah <sil> 
            I have to transport four boxcars of oranges to Bath by two p.m. 
utt3  : s:  okay 
utt4  : u:  um <sil> so I guess <sil> let's see <sil> Bath <sil> 
            um boxcars are available <sil> um <sil> in Dansville and <sil> 
            Elmira right 
utt5  : s:  yes 
utt6  : u:  and <sil> um <sil> if it <sil> let's see um how long would it take <sil> 
            to get <sil> an engine to pick those up 
utt7  :     if I <brth> well let's see if two are <sil> in Elmira <sil> 
            with the engine <sil> 
            and I'd have to go to Danville how long would that take to get another 
            two 
utt8  : s:  i- so you want to take <sil> 
            an engine and boxcar from Elmira to Dansville is that what you're asking 
utt9  : u:  um <sil> I guess take <sil> o(ne)- <sil> one engine and two boxcars 
utt10 : s:  + okay + 
utt11 : u:  + y- <sil> + yeah from Elmira to <sil> Dansville 
utt12 : s:  that would take <sil> three hours 
utt13 : u:  three <sil> hours 
utt14 :     okay <sil> um <sil> oh wait <sil> then where are the oranges <sil> 
            the oranges are oh in the orange ware- okay and then back to Corning how 
            would that <sil> how long that would take 
utt15 : s:  okay um <sil> to take <sil> 
            an engine and two boxcars from Elmira to Dansville would take <sil> 
            three hours and then you want to pick up another one and go back to 
            Corning 
utt16 : u:  um yes 
utt17 : s:  okay <sil> um + that would be f(ive)- + 
utt18 : u:  + oh actually two + 
utt19 : s:  that'd <sil> be five hours in all 
utt20 : u:  okay and then how about <sil> to go to Bath 
utt21 : s:  um from Corning 
utt22 : u:  yeah 
utt23 : s:  that's two hours 
utt24 : u:  two hours so that's <sil> seven hours in all <sil> + with + 
utt25 : s:  + yes + <sil> but it takes an hour to load the oranges 
utt26 : u:  oh it does okay so that's <sil> eight 
utt27 : s:  I don't know though if it's an hour <sil> per boxcar or an hour in all 
utt28 : u:  + oh + 
utt29 : s:  + that's + a problem 
utt30 : u:  okay 
utt31 : s:  I don't know if I can give any help on that either <sil> let's see <sil> 
            it takes one hour to load or unload any amount of <sil> 
            cargo on a train 
utt32 :     so I guess that would be an hour <sil> 
            no matter how many boxcars you have 
utt33 : u:  okay 
utt34 :     so <sil> if we want to get there by <sil> two p.m. and it takes <sil> 
            eight hours in all 
utt35 :     so that would <sil> um <sil> if we left at six in the morning <sil> 
            would that make sense six <mumble> 
utt36 :     um <sil> yeah I guess <sil> <click> um <sil> 
            <click> or we could leave now I- <sil> 
            I guess it doesn't matter um <sil> do(es)- <sil> 
            does that sound like it makes sense to transport 
utt37 : s:  okay which we- which engine do you wanna take from Elmira 
utt38 : u:  um <sil> ar- <sil> i- are there differences in the engines 
utt39 : s:  no <sil> I just it just <sil> makes it clearer 
utt40 : u:  oh okay <sil> um I guess <sil> engine <sil> two 
utt41 : s:  okay 
utt42 : u:  with the two boxcars that are available there 
utt43 : s:  okay 
utt44 : u:  um <sil> do you have to go through Corning to get to Dansville <sil> 
            + is that + 
utt45 : s:  + yes + you do 
utt46 : u:  you do okay <sil> um 
utt47 :     so <sil> yeah <sil> um <sil> I guess the instructions <sil> are <sil> 
            would I be giving you instructions <sil> I don't even know 
utt48 : s:  yeah + <sil> i- <sil> you have t- + you decide what the plan is 
utt49 : u:  + I- okay <sil> um + 
utt50 :     yeah <sil> um 
utt51 :     so take engine two with two boxcars um <sil> 
            from Elmira to Dansville <sil> and there pick up <sil> 
            another two boxcars <sil> and travel to Corning 
utt52 : s:  okay 
utt53 : u:  load <sil> the oranges <sil> + and + 
utt54 : s:  + you want to + pick up <sil> two boxcars or one at Dansville 
utt55 : u:  um <sil> two since we onl- <sil> there's only two + <sil> 
            available in Elmira + 
utt56 : s:  + okay you can only + carry <sil> um <sil> 
            you can carry three empty boxcars <sil> that would be fine <sil> 
            but once you get them loaded <sil> 
            you can carry as many um unloaded boxcars as you want but + once you get 
            them + loaded <sil> you can only <sil> carry three at a time 
utt57 : u:  + mm-hm + 
utt58 :     oh okay 
utt59 : s:  just so you know 
utt60 : u:  okay so then um <sil> why don't <sil> uh <sil> hm <sil> <noise> <sil> 
            um <sil> okay so why don't <sil> um <sil> take engine two 
utt61 :     with the two boxcars available 
utt62 : s:  + mm-hm + 
utt63 : u:  + um + <sil> <click> <sil> go <sil> from <sil> Elmira to Corning 
utt64 :     pick up <sil> and load two <sil> um <sil> <brth> <sil> the two <sil> 
            uh boxcars <sil> on engine two with oranges and then continue to Bath 
utt65 :     um at the same time engine three <sil> <sil> would go <sil> um <sil> 
            from Elmira to Corning <sil> to Dansville 
utt66 :     pick up the two <sil> oh <sil> 
            well yeah pick up the two boxcars that are available there <sil> 
            travel back to Corning 
utt67 : s:  okay 
utt68 : u:  load those and then go to Bath 
utt69 : s:  oh okay 
utt70 : u:  um <sil> o- and the time <sil> there's no <sil> 
            if we left now the time wouldn't <sil> affect that would it 
utt71 : s:  oh okay so you <sil> it's twelve a.m. now right 
utt72 : u:  yeah 
utt73 : s:  so it takes <sil> <noise> <sil> 
            ooh if you leave Elmira at twelve a.m. with the two boxcars <sil> 
            you get to Corning at two a.m. 
utt74 :     and it takes you an hour to load the oranges <sil> 
            so you'll have them loaded by three a.m. 
utt75 : u:  mm-hm 
utt76 : s:  do you want to go right from there to Bath <sil> 
            as soon as you have those two loaded 
utt77 : u:  um <sil> yep <sil> I guess so 
utt78 : s:  okay <sil> those'll get to Bath at <sil> five a.m. 
utt79 :     now meanwhile while this is happening you want <sil> engine three <sil> 
            to go to Dansville and pick up <sil> two more boxcars 
utt80 : u:  well what's the difference if um <sil> those bo- boxcars <sil> 
            arrive at Bath at three a.m. that's right 
utt81 : s:  uh-huh 
utt82 : u:  um 
utt83 : s:  uh no at five a.m. 
utt84 : u:  five a.m. okay <sil> is it faster for those <sil> for that engine <sil> 
            to drop off those two bascar- <sil> those two boxcars <sil> 
            travel back to Dansville <sil> than <sil> + um to have engine three + 
utt85 : s:  + um no <sil> + it's the same <sil> 
            uh amount of time from Elmira to Dansville as it is from Bath to 
            Dansville 
utt86 : u:  <click> okay <sil> so then <sil> yeah jus- <sil> I guess just have <sil> 
            the <sil> the original <sil> take the two <sil> 
            ha(ve)- have them leave at the same time 
utt87 : s:  okay <sil> um <sil> so engine E three <sil> to Dansville 
utt88 : u:  yep 
utt89 : s:  okay that gets there at three a.m. <sil> 
            I'm sorry I'm a little bit slow + <sil> <laughter> + 
utt90 : u:  + no that's okay + <laughter> <sil> you know more than I do 
utt91 : s:  uh not really + <laughter> +
