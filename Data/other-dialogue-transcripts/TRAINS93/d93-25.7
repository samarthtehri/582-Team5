            still have the tanker of OJ 
utt53 : s:  mm-hm <sil> 
            and it has to leave Elmira as soon as it's been + processed <sil> + and 
            it will be finished processing at six a.m. 
utt54 : u:  + yes + 
utt55 :     okay <brth> so at six a.m. <sil> I'll leave <sil> from dans- <sil> 
            from Elmira 
utt56 : s:  mm-hm 
utt57 : u:  to Dansville <sil> how long will that take <sil> 
            what time will it be when I get there 
utt58 : s:  um <sil> it will be <sil> wait <sil> that doesn't make sense 
utt59 :     oh it's gonna have to <sil> 
            wait a little while at Corning otherwise it and the other engine will be 
            running on the track at the same time 
utt60 : u:  okay + + 
utt61 : s:  + because + of the way loadings <sil> 
            so why don't you have it wait at Corning 
utt62 : u:  okay I'll have it wait at Corning then while the other one waits at 
            Dansville 
utt63 : s:  okay 
utt64 : u:  and what time will it be when it's at Corning 
utt65 : s:  um it will be at Corning at eight a.m. 
utt66 : u:  okay <sil> so I guess <brth> let's see <sil> 
            it'll take four hours it'll be twelve so I guess it should wait there 
            also for three hours 
utt67 : s:  okay 
utt68 : u:  and <sil> then <sil> in three hours have both <sil> 
            oh they can't both go over at the same time though can they 
utt69 : s:  um one can be leaving Dansville while one's leaving Corning + that's not 
            + a + problem + 
utt70 : u:  + okay + 
utt71 :     + so I + guess they'll both <sil> 
            they'll both leave in three hours after they arrive <sil> 
            at + their + destination 
utt72 : s:  + okay +

utt74 : u:  okay 
utt75 : s:  or shor- <sil> 
            or you could have it wait four you should have it wait four hours <sil> 
            do you have a time limit of when you need to be in Avon <sil> at all 
utt76 : u:  uh nope <sil> just can't be there before three p.m. 
utt77 : s:  okay why don't you have it wait there four hours then and then it'll get 
            in there at four p.m.
