utt1  : s:  hello <sil> can I help you
utt2  : u:  yeah I want t- I want to determine the maximum number of boxcars of
            oranges <sil> that I can get to Bath <sil> by seven a.m. <sil>
            tomorrow morning
utt3  :     so <brth> hm <sil>
            so I guess all the boxcars will have to go through oran- <sil>
            through Corning because that's where the orange juice <brth>
            orange factory is
utt4  :     so from Corning to Bath how far is that
utt5  : s:  two hours
utt6  : u:  and it's gonna take us also an hour to load <sil> boxcars right
utt7  : s:  right + +
utt8  : u:  + okay + so <sil> hm so <sil> every trip will take at least <sil>
            three hours <sil> then
utt9  :     um
utt10 : s:  right we can unload any amount of cargo onto a train in one hour
utt11 :     so we can + <sil> do a maximum of three + boxcars in an hour
utt12 : u:  + right <sil> okay +
utt13 :     okay <sil> so I guess one thing we can do oh <brth> so <brth>
            I guess one thing is that we should see how many boxcars we can actually
            get to Corning in four hours
utt14 :     um how far is it from Avon to Bath <sil> to Corning
utt15 : s:  <click> <brth> that's six hours it's + shorter + through Dansville
utt16 : u:  + okay +
utt17 :     from Avon oh no but the thing is is that I was thinking if s- <sil>
            I was wondering if we could actually pick up those two boxcars which are
            at <sil> + Bath +
utt18 : s:  + mm +
utt19 : u:  but I think that we can't even put them in <sil> to <brth>
            that they won't even come in to play
utt20 :     unless how far is it from Elmira <brth> to Bath
utt21 : s:  two hours
utt22 : u:  oh really <sil> so then w- we could actually take <brth>
            like engine E two
utt23 :     have it go to bath <sil> pick up those two box cars there
utt24 :     take it to Corn- how long from Bath to Corning an hour I guess
utt25 : s:  two hours
utt26 : u:  oh wait a second I thought <sil> well from from like Elmira <brth>
            through to Corning to Bath is how many hours
utt27 : s:  four hours + +
utt28 : u:  + oh + that's four hours so wa- we're like screwed as far as tho- those
            two box cars at Bath go
utt29 :     like I don- I don't think we s- so to get the maximum number of box cars
            of oranges <brth>
            to bath by seven am I don't think we can even use those two at bath
utt30 :     because there <sil> we because we can't get an engine <brth>
            to Bath in time
utt31 : s:  that's right
utt32 : u:  okay <brth> so we have the three boxcars at <sil> Dansville
utt33 :     so how far is it from Avon to Danville
utt34 : s:  three hours
utt35 : u:  three hours then from Dansville to Corning
utt36 : s:  one hour
utt37 : u:  okay so we we can actually use those three boxcars right
utt38 : s:  mm-hm
utt39 : u:  okay so that's three boxcars
utt40 :     okay so that's engine E one
utt41 :     from Avon going to Dansville <sil> pick up the three boxcars
utt42 :     go to Corning load them up and then take it to Bath
utt43 :     okay so that's <sil> good
