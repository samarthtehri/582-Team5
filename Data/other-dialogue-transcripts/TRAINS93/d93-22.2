utt54 : s:  let's see that's <sil> 
            five hours after filling it with orange juice and then <sil> 
            from Elmira to Bath <sil> um <sil> seven eight nine hours 
utt55 :     so <sil> if <sil> we <sil> start at <sil> um <sil>

            engine E three and engine E two <sil> on the same track <sil> 
            between Elmira and Corning at the same time and that won't work 
utt58 : u:  correct <sil> okay <brth> 
            so what we're gonna have to do is we're gonna have to import an engine 
            <sil> for <sil> either one 
utt59 : s:  actually an engine can carry <sil> um <sil> 
            a boxcar and a tanker at the same time 
utt60 : u:  well wouldn't that be handy <sil> okay 
utt61 :     so what we'll do <sil> is <sil> 
            the boxcar of bananas which is coming from <sil> Avon <sil> 
            is that correct 
utt62 :     we are t- picking up an <sil> 
            we're picking up a boxcar in Dansville coming back <sil> 
            getting the bananas <sil> right 
utt63 :     o- on our way instead of going directly into Bath 
utt64 : s:  mm-hm 
utt65 : u:  could we go on to Corning <sil> and pick up a tanker 
utt66 : s:  wait wait wait okay so <sil> 
            so this is engine E one that you're talking about that + went to + 
utt67 : u:  + engine E + one goes to Dansville to get a boxcar right 
utt68 : s:  right 
utt69 : u:  and then it comes back and fills full of bananas 
utt70 : s:  <click> <sil> right 
utt71 : u:  instead of going to Bath <sil> how about if it went to Corning <sil> 
            ooh <sil> how about <sil> this <sil> it can go into Bath <sil> 
            drop off the bananas 
utt72 :     and then go to Corning <sil> pick up a tanker 
utt73 :     go to Elmira <sil> and <sil> fill the tanker full of orange juice 
utt74 : s:  this may be taking too much time cause you've already <sil> 
            you've got it <sil> 
            oh alright so instead of going to Dansville you're just gonna go 
            straight to Bath alright that's <sil> skips some time 
utt75 : u:  right 
utt76 :     so what we're doing now <sil> is <sil> we've got <sil> 
            our- we've got our engine one <sil> in the banana warehouse 
utt77 : s:  mm-hm 
utt78 : u:  first it has to go to Dansville because it needs a boxcar <sil> 
            then it comes back to Avon <sil> that's two hours right 
utt79 : s:  uh it's six hours to Dansville so that's <sil> 
            + um excuse + me it's three hours to Dansville so that's six hours total 
utt80 : u:  + ooh + 
utt81 :     okay <sil> and now <sil> it fills the bananas <sil> and it goes to Bath 
utt82 : s:  okay
