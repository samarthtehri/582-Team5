            we need to get um <sil> to <sil> Dansville <sil> two boxcars of oranges 
utt35 :     right 
utt36 : s:  why to Dansville <sil> I thought we had to go to Avon 
utt37 : u:  well <sil> i- cause it uh <sil> the engine <sil> goes from uh <sil> 
            runs back and forth between Avon and Dansville 
utt38 : s:  okay 
utt39 : u:  until nine a.m. 
utt40 : s:  okay 
utt41 : u:  so it's not gonna be going to <sil> 
            the easiest + way since it's not + going to Bath or Corning 
utt42 : s:  + oh okay + 
utt43 :     okay <sil> okay I see what you're saying <sil> okay good 
utt44 : u:  okay <sil> so um <sil> need to get two boxcars of oranges <sil> to Avon 
utt45 : s:  okay 
utt46 : u:  through Dansville 
utt47 : s:  okay 
utt48 : u:  um <sil> <mumble> let me see where are the oranges <sil> 
            oranges are in Corning + + 
utt49 : s:  + + right 
utt50 : u:  um <sil> there are three boxcars <sil> in Dansville 
utt51 : s:  yep 
utt52 : u:  um 
utt53 : s:  oh there's also <sil> two in Elmira 
utt54 : u:  two in Elmira <sil> oh um hm + <sil> okay + 
utt55 : s:  + so all that + we <sil> need is two boxcars of oranges right 
utt56 : u:  yes 
utt57 : s:  okay 
utt58 : u:  um <sil> which is the shorter distance from Dansville <sil> 
            to Corning or Elmira to Corning 
utt59 : s:  it's actually only one hour from Corning to Dansville <brth> 
            but the thing is is that we don't have an engine in Dansville anyways + 
            right + 
utt60 : u:  + oh + okay 
utt61 : s:  so 
utt62 : u:  alright so uh <sil> from Elmira <sil> we'll bring uh <sil> two boxcars 
utt63 : s:  okay 
utt64 : u:  with engine <sil> E two 
utt65 : s:  okay 
utt66 : u:  to Corning 
utt67 : s:  okay so that'll get to Corning at <sil> + two a.m. + 
utt68 : u:  + mm-hm + <sil> and then <sil> we will <sil> put uh <sil> 
            fill the boxcars with oranges 
utt69 : s:  okay so that'll be <sil> three a.m. then 
utt70 : u:  then <sil> take the <sil> two boxcars <brth> through Dansville <sil> 
            to Avon 
utt71 : s:  okay <sil> um <brth> so <sil> from Corning to Dansville was one hour 
utt72 : u:  mm-hm 
utt73 : s:  okay so that was so we'll get to Dansville about four a.m. <brth> 
            now <sil> the other problem is is that if we have this train <brth> 
            so we also have engine E one that's going back and forth right 
utt74 : u:  oh right <sil> + that's true + 
utt75 : s:  + okay + so I'm wondering if we're gonna <sil> um <brth> 
            so we have to make sure that we don't <sil> run into that train 
utt76 : u:  mm-hm 
utt77 : s:  so if we get to Dansville at four a.m. <sil> 
            so engine E one is going back and forth <sil> 
            starting at midnight till nine a.m. 
utt78 : u:  mm-hm 
utt79 : s:  bringing okay <sil> so it must <sil> so from <sil> <brth> 
            so from midnight to nine a.m. <sil> it's going back and forth 
utt80 : u:  mm-hm 
utt81 : s:  oh + okay + 
utt82 : u:  + what is it going + back and forth on just an engine <sil> 
            can we use that engine 
utt83 : s:  yeah so what we could do is is that if it <brth> 
            well it's gonna get to <sil> so it gets to Avon <sil> 
            so it starts at Avon right so <brth> 
            at three a.m. it'll get to Dansville 
utt84 :     then it must drop off <sil> 
            then maybe it unloads the oranges I'm not s(ure)- uh the the bananas 
utt85 : u:  um <sil> picks up boxcars in Dansville 
utt86 : s:  yep 
utt87 : u:  and then continually runs back and forth between Avon and Dansville 
utt88 : s:  okay 
utt89 : u:  carrying three boxcars of bananas <sil> to Dansville + on every + trip 
utt90 : s:  + okay + 
utt91 :     okay 
utt92 : u:  + so it's it + 
utt93 : s:  + and that + runs until what time 
utt94 : u:  until nine a.m. 
utt95 : s:  okay <sil> 
            so at three a.m. it would get to Dansville it would pick up the three 
            boxcars and then go back to + Avon + 
utt96 : u:  + n- <sil> + no it would uh <sil> 
            it will be carrying three box of bananas to Dansville 
utt97 : s:  right to Dansville <sil> + okay + 
utt98 : u:  + so it will be + returning to Avon empty 
utt99 : s:  right okay <sil> so <brth> we could actually have it <sil> 
            so we're not gonna get to Dansville until four a.m. 
utt100:     so we would have missed it <sil> when it was there at three a.m. 
utt101: u:  mm-hm 
utt102: s:  so we could just probably <sil> 
            so now the th- so what we're probably gonna have to do is to actually 
            wait at Dansville until it next comes 
utt103: u:  right 
utt104: s:  + okay + 
utt105: u:  + okay + 
utt106: s:  so which will probably be around um <sil> 
            so it must have it must load the bananas into those three boxcars 
utt107:     so it would leave <sil> Avon at seven 
utt108:     and get to Dansville <sil> 
            or actually the other thing is is that why don't we just <brth> 
            um go via Bath <sil> to to Avon + + 
utt109: u:  + + okay 
utt110: s:  even though that route's a bit longer <sil> 
            at + least then we don't + have any conflict 
utt111: u:  + it will save time + 
utt112:     okay 
utt113: s:  yeah because then <sil> 
            so if we get to c- so we were at Corning at <sil> 
            so we had the boxcars loaded up at three a.m. 
utt114:     so we go to Bath <sil> 
            + that'll be + five a.m. we go to Avon that'll be nine a.m. 
utt115: u:  + mm-hm + 
utt116:     right 
utt117: s:  so we'll get there at nine a.m. 
utt118:     okay 
utt119: u:  okay
