utt76 : s:  + uh-huh + 
utt77 : u:  + and then + <sil> go to <sil> uh from Elmira to Avon <sil> via <sil> 
            Corning and <sil> Dansville 
utt78 : s:  okay <sil> uh we have <sil> to make sure not <sil> 
            to run into the other <sil> train 
utt79 : u:  oh okay 
utt80 : s:  uh 
utt81 : u:  uh <sil> okay so let me 
utt82 : s:  so 
utt83 : u:  okay the <sil> the bananas are going to Corning by three 
utt84 : s:  + right the <sil> + um 
utt85 : u:  + okay + 
utt86 :     okay what's the original I'm say- <sil> 
            do you have the original route of the bananas 
utt87 : s:  the bananas we were gonna take engine E two 
utt88 : u:  + okay + 
utt89 : s:  + go from + <sil> Elmira to Corning to Dansville 
utt90 : u:  + okay + 
utt91 : s:  + pick + up a <sil> boxcar <sil> go to Avon <sil> pick up <sil> 
            bananas and <sil> uh <sil> and <sil> um <sil> back <sil> um 
utt92 : u:  back + to C(orning)- + 
utt93 : s:  + back + to Corning <sil> by <sil> + Dansville + 
utt94 : u:  + via Dansville + 
utt95 :     + okay + 
utt96 : s:  + right + 
utt97 : u:  alright well we could go <sil> 
            well we have time to spare right so we could probably go <sil> 
            back to Corning <sil> via Bath 
utt98 : s:  <click> <sil> um <sil> that would take an extra <sil> 
            two hours so that would be one <sil> + one + p.m. 
utt99 : u:  + okay + 
utt100:     alright so we'd still make it there on time 
utt101: s:  right 
utt102: u:  and then the other tracks would be open for us to <sil> 
            bring the tanker of OJ 
utt103: s:  right <sil> um <sil> the only problem is <sil> that <sil> um <sil> 
            you can't have both engine two and engine three leaving Elmira at the 
            same time 
utt104: u:  oh + okay + 
utt105: s:  + so one + would have to be <sil> delayed by an hour 
utt106: u:  okay <sil> um <brth> alright well how about if <sil> 
            we use <clicks> <sil> how about if we use <sil> 
            engine one instead then and go to <sil> pick up a boxcar in Dansville 
utt107:     and then bring it back to <sil> Avon <sil> for <sil> 
            to fill it up with bananas 
utt108: s:  mm-hm 
utt109: u:  <click> <sil> and then go via Bath <sil> back to Corning 
utt110:     Dansville to + Avon + is <sil> how long 
utt111: s:  + okay + 
utt112:     um 
utt113: u:  + four + 
utt114: s:  + three + uh + three + hours 
utt115: u:  + three + 
utt116:     okay so it takes six to go back and forth <sil> 
            an hour to fill up would be seven 
utt117:     and then <sil> <click> <sil> 
            what was it like another s- six hours to Corning via Bath 
utt118: s:  right 
utt119: u:  alright so we'd have enough time 
utt120: s:  right <sil> that would be <sil> one o'clock 
utt121: u:  if I use engine one <sil> okay 
utt122:     and then can I use the other one <sil> the <sil> <click> <sil> 
            my original plan for uh <sil> f- for the O(J)- <sil> the <sil> 
            tanker of OJ with engine two 
utt123: s:  with engine two instead of engine three 
utt124: u:  right 
utt125: s:  okay so engine <sil> two will 
utt126: u:  so engine three won't get used 
utt127: s:  okay <brth> engine two <sil> will <sil> pick up a boxcar 
utt128: u:  drive to Corning and get the <sil> oranges and a tanker 
utt129: s:  right 
utt130: u:  then <sil> back to the OJ factory <sil> to make it 
utt131: s:  okay just a second <sil> um 
utt132:     uh-uh 
utt133:     okay <sil> ba(ck)- back to Elmira 
utt134: u:  right <sil> to make the OJ and then go + back to <sil> + Avon via <sil> 
            Corning and Dansville 
utt135: s:  + uh-huh + 
utt136:     um 
utt137: u:  so there shouldn't be any <sil> overlap of the + tracks + 
utt138: s:  + right + <sil> so that would get there at <sil> two p.m. 
utt139: u:  okay <sil> um 
utt140: s:  so 
utt141: u:  <click> <sil> I <sil> is the problem solved then 
utt142: s:  uh yes 
utt143: u:  okay <sil> I'm <sil> finished <laughter> 
utt144: s:  okay
