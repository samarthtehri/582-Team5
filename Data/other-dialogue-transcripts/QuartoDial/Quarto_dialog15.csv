15,100,4,"Same , Confirm(User_ID=1, Color)","Okay. In this case, does the color have anything to do with why I've won?",Negate(),"Nope, it's not that.",Dave,5,4,Daniel,,0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-10-13-9-2
15,100,5,"Context Switch, Request(User_ID=1, Rotate)",Let's take a look at the previous example. Which rotations of these pieces about the blue piece would also count?,"Inform([0, 45])","You could place them along the bottom row, or along the diagonal up to the top-right corner, and it would also count as a win.",Dave,5,5,Daniel,,1-0-0-0-3-0-0-0-7-0-0-0-6-0-0-0
